  <h1>Physio</h1>

  <p>
    Up here I'd love to see a calendar with days crossed off with red Xs
    but I'll accept a "# of days in a row that you've done all your exercises!"
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Exercise 1 (button for # reps or time per rep or single rep?)</li>
    <li>more exercises</li>
    <li>more exercises</li>
  </ol>
